# Dropout Exploration Notebook

## Overview

This notebook explores the concept of Dropout in Fully Connected Networks, both from a theoretical and practical standpoint. The notebook is inspired by CS182 and provides a detailed analysis of how Dropout works, why it is effective, and its implications in neural network training. The notebook also includes practical examples using linear regression and the CIFAR-10 dataset to demonstrate the effects of Dropout on model training and generalization.

## Table of Contents

## Key Concepts

### Why Dropout Works
- **Regularization**: Dropout acts as a form of regularization, smoothing the loss landscape and improving the condition number of the feature matrix.
- **Distributed Representation**: Dropout encourages the network to learn distributed representations, where multiple neurons contribute to detecting a feature rather than relying on a single neuron.
- **Ensemble Learning**: Dropout can be interpreted as training an ensemble of sub-networks, which improves generalization performance.

### Practical Implications
- **Linear Regression Example**: The notebook demonstrates how Dropout changes the inductive bias of gradient descent, leading to a more distributed solution rather than a minimum-norm solution.
- **CIFAR-10 Example**: The notebook explores the effect of Dropout in a real-world setting using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Code Implementation

The notebook includes code implementations for:
- **Linear Regression**: Demonstrates the effect of Dropout on a simple linear regression problem.
- **Gradient Descent**: Shows how Dropout affects the convergence of gradient descent in a neural network.
